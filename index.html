                    Mobile gaming is all the rage recently and smartphones such as the Razer Phone, ASUS ROG Phone, and Xiaomi Black Shark are being released to capitalize off of that market. However, not all of us can afford (or want) these gaming phones just to play the latest mobile games. If you aren’t on the latest flagship device like the Samsung Galaxy S9, OnePlus 6, or Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S with the latest flagship chip like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845, then games like PlayerUnknown’s BattleGrounds (PUBG) can have trouble running. But thanks to GFX Tool by XDA Member tsoml, you can drastically improve the performance of PUBG. If you’re interested on improving the FPS in PUBG, you can follow our tutorial below! <strong>Note that you will need root access for version 0.7.</strong> We recommend rooting your smartphone with <strong>Magisk.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-performance">
                    If you’re wondering what kind of performance gains you can expect to see, it just about doubled the frame rates on the OnePlus 3 powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 and Adreno 530 GPU. We confirmed that our frame rate before making the changes was, on average, 26 at medium graphics. Afterwards, the frame rates hovered around 40-50 FPS on average. You should definitely see an improvement.

                            <h2>Configuring GFX Tool</h2>
                        <div class="details">
                            <h3>Version</h3>
                            <p>
                            This is the most important part about setting the application up. If you choose version 0.7, the application will request root access as it’s impossible to access the targeted FPS without it. Across the world and in Korea, though, version 0.6 is still the latest version released. You must check what version your game is before trying to run it through GFX Tool.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="details">
                            <h3>Resolution</h3>
                            <p>
                            This part is pretty self-explanatory. The game on the OnePlus 3 runs at 1920×1080, so halving the resolution to 960×540 means a smoother downscale while also greatly reducing the number of pixels needing to be rendered.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Graphics</h3>
                            <p>
                            PUBG has a number of graphics options available to users, but there are even more not shown to the user. You can enable super high fidelity graphics here that aren’t normally accessible, so you can give that a try if you want. Smooth is lower than usual graphics, so it helps to squeeze out some more FPS.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="details">
                            <h3>FPS</h3>
                            <p>
                            This is the maximum FPS that we want. You’ll want to set this to 60 unless you’re trying to avoid thermal throttling. The higher the value the better the fluidity, but the more power is needed.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Anti-aliasing</h3>
                            <p>
                            Anti-aliasing often removes “jaggedness” of textures, but at the cost of performance. Disabling this will net you higher FPS.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Style</h3>
                            <p>
                            Style refers to the saturation levels and colours in-game. You don’t need to worry about this setting as it’s purely cosmetic.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Shadows</h3>
                            <p>
                            While disabling shadows may net you a higher performance, it’s often a poor idea to disable them in games like PUBG. They can be advantageous, so it’s better to leave it on “Skip” and let the game decide.
                            </p>
                        </div><div class="details">
                            <h3>Vulkan</h3>
                            <p>
                            Vulkan refers to the usage of the Vulkan Graphics API which can improve performance but requires a supported device. The latest devices should support Vulkan, but if the game fails to start you’ll want to make sure this option is off. Attempting to use it on unsupported devices will make the game crash at launch.                            
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Now, this is the simple—and fun—part. All you have to do is hit “accept.” The accept button will switch to a run game button, so then all you have to do is launch the game and you’re good to go. Once the game launches, you should see that your settings have applied as the resolution will be lower. Queue up a game and give it a test drive, you should notice it’s much smoother than before.
